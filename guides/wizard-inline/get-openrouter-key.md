# Get Your OpenRouter API Key (Easiest Option)

**Estimated time: 3-5 minutes**

OpenRouter is the **easiest way** to get started. It's a service that gives you access to **all the major AI models** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and many more — with just **one API key and one bill**. Instead of signing up with each AI company separately, you sign up once with OpenRouter and get access to everything.

Think of it like a phone plan that lets you call any network, instead of needing a separate plan for each one.

**What it costs:** You pay based on how much your agent is used. Prices vary by model, but expect roughly **$5-60 per month** for typical personal usage. You add credits (pre-pay) and they get used up as your agent chats.

## Understanding Costs

OpenRouter charges per-use, passing through the cost of each AI model. Here are some rough estimates for common models:

| Model | Cost Level | Good For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | $ (cheapest) | Quick, everyday conversations |
| GPT-4o Mini | $ (cheap) | Fast, budget-friendly responses |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $$ (moderate) | Great balance of quality and cost |
| GPT-4o | $$ (moderate) | Strong all-around performance |
| Claude 3 Opus | $$$ (expensive) | Highest quality, most thoughtful responses |

For most personal use, **$10-20/month** is plenty when using moderate-cost models.

> **Tip:** You can check exact per-message pricing on the OpenRouter models page at **https://openrouter.ai/models**.
